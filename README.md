## Project Description
Your task is to create a Python terminal application that collects sides A and B of a right triangle and uses the Pythagorean Theorem to output side C.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create these issues on a projects page
    - 1. Pull repository.
    - 2. Add comments as a list of tasks necessary to code the project.
    - 3. Output in the app what your program is designed to do (purpose and instructions to the user).
    - 4. Collect sides A and B in the form of a float value.
    - 5. Solve for C using the equation C^2 = A^2 + B^2
         -   To use square roots, add ```import math``` at the top of the file
         -   To solve for the square root, ```math.sqrt(variable)```
    - Output the value of C with a label.
- [ ] Create a branch called ```Testing```
- [ ] Commit code when needing to save to a secondary branch called ```Testing```.
- [ ] When finishing coding and running your program for zero errors, do a final commit.
- [ ] Create a Pull Request.
- [ ] Merge your ```Testing``` branch into your ```main``` branch.
- [ ] Move all completed issues into the project Completed column.
